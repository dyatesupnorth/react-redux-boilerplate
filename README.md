# React + Redux Boilerplate with Firebase Auth

This is my starter build for projects requiring React, Redux and some basic Auth provided by Firebase.

## Instructions

- Clone repo.
- Run `yarn`.
-Fill in credentials in `.env.development` & `.env.test`. This step will require you to setup up appropriate accounts and projects in Firebase.
- Run `yarn dev-server` for your development build.
- Run `yarn test` to run test suite.
